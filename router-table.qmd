### STEP A | Prep

1. Glue the `fence-back` *x3* pieces together. Let dry.
2. Glue the `top` *x2* pieces together. Let dry.


### STEP B | Template

3. Use the paper template provided with the router plate to make a wood template. Position the wood template centered on the prepared `top`.
4. Trace the wood template opening onto the `top` and remove.

### STEP C | Inner Opening

5. Drill a hole in the center of the `top` in the traced opening.
6. Starting from the center hole, use a jigsaw to rough out the opening.^[attempt to get as close as possible to the traced opening without touching]
7. Replace the wood template and use a router with a template bit to clean up the opening
8. Remove the template

### STEP D | Outter Opening

9. Set the router depth to just past the thickness of the router plate.^[leveling pins will bring this flush]
10. Use a router with a rabbet bit to route out the pocket for the router plate.

### STEP E | Channel

11. Route out the dovetail tracks in the `top` positioned 19 mm away from both edges of the router plate

### STEP F | Fence
